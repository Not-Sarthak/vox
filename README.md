### Problem it Solves:

Many Indians have experienced the disappointment of being turned away at events due to fake tickets. High-demand events often lead to extreme price hikes in the resale market, pricing out many fans. When plans change, ticket holders often struggle to resell their tickets in a secure and legal manner that benefits both them and the buyer.

These issues are very common across India, especially in major cities during popular events like IPL matches or international music tours or even regional festivals.

Along with all these technicalities, we want to abstract away some complexities that can benefit buyers and sellers to have a pleasant and non-overwhelming experience on Vox.
